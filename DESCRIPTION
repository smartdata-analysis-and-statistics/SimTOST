Description: SimTOST is an R package designed for bioequivalence studies, providing simulation-based sample size estimation for the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure. With flexible options for testing multiple hypotheses, treatments, and correlated endpoints, SimTOST enables robust planning of bioequivalence trials by accommodating complex study designs.
