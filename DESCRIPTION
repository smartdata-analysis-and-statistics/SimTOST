Description: 
    Sample size estimation for bio-equivalence trials is supported through a simulation-based approach 
    that extends the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure. The methodology provides flexibility in 
    hypothesis testing, accommodates multiple treatment comparisons, and accounts for correlated endpoints. 
    Users can model complex trial scenarios, including parallel and crossover designs, intra-subject variability, 
    and different equivalence margins. Monte Carlo simulations enable accurate estimation of power and type I error 
    rates, ensuring well-calibrated study designs. The statistical framework builds on established methods for 
    equivalence testing and multiple hypothesis testing in bio-equivalence studies, as described in Schuirmann (1987)
