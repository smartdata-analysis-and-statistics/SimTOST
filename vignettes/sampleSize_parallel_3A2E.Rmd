# Introduction

In many studies, it is necessary to evaluate equivalence across multiple primary variables. For instance, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends demonstrating equivalence for both **Area Under the Curve** (AUC) and **maximum concentration** (Cmax) when assessing pharmacokinetic properties.

When multiple primary endpoints are involved, a decision must be made on the desired criteria for equivalence:

* Equivalence for All Primary Endpoints
  * This is the most common setting and is often referred to as having *multiple co-primary endpoints*.
  * Equivalence must be demonstrated for **all** endpoints to conclude overall equivalence.
* Equivalence for At Least One Primary Endpoint
  * Known as having *multiple primary endpoints*.
  * Equivalence is required for **at least one** endpoint to meet the study's objectives.

This vignette presents advanced techniques for calculating sample size in parallel trial designs involving three treatment arms and two endpoints. Specifically, it focuses on bioequivalence testing between a new treatment (SB2) and a reference drug (Remicade) administered in two distinct locations (EU_Remicade and USA_Remicade).

# Methodology and Assumptions

The endpoints of interest are:

* AUCinf: Area Under the Curve (infinity)
* Cmax: Maximum concentration

For both endpoints, the analysis assumes that:

* Summary data are available on the original scale (e.g., mean and standard deviation).
* These data are provided for each treatment arm.

This vignette demonstrates how to compute the required sample size for testing bioequivalence, ensuring robust conclusions across endpoints in this three-arm parallel trial design.
