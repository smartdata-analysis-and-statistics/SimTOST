In the examples below, we demonstrate the use of **SimTOST** for parallel trial designs. To begin, we first load the package.

```{r, echo = T, message=F}
library(SimTOST)
```

# Multiple Independent Co-Primary Endpoints
We here consider a bio-equivalence trial with 2 treatment arms and $m=5$ endpoints. The sample size is calculated to ensure that the test and reference products are equivalent with respect to all 5 endpoints. The true ratio between the test and reference products is assumed to be 1.05. It is assumed that the standard deviation of the log-transformed response variable is $\sigma = 0.3$, and that all tests are independent ($\rho = 0$). The equivalence limits are set at 0.80 and 1.25. The significance level is 0.05. The sample size is determined at a power of 0.8. 

This example is adapted from @mielke_sample_2018, who employed a difference-of-means test on the log scale. The sample size calculation can be conducted using two approaches, both of which are illustrated below.

## Approach 1: Using sampleSize_Mielke
In the first approach, we calculate the required sample size for 80% power using the [sampleSize_Mielke()](../reference/sampleSize_Mielke.html) function. This method directly follows the approach described in @mielke_sample_2018, assuming a difference-of-means test on the log-transformed scale with specified parameters.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ssMielke <- sampleSize_Mielke(power = 0.8, Nmax = 1000, m = 5, k = 5, rho = 0, 
                              sigma = 0.3, true.diff = log(1.05), 
                              equi.tol = log(1.25), design = "parallel", 
                              alpha = 0.05, adjust = "no", seed = 1234, 
                              nsim = 10000)
ssMielke
```
For 80\% power, `r ssMielke["SS"]` subjects per sequence (`r ssMielke["SS"] * 2` in total) would have been required. 

## Approach 2: Using sampleSize
Alternatively, the sample size calculation can be performed using the [sampleSize()](../reference/sampleSize.html) function. This method assumes that effect sizes are normally distributed on the log scale and uses a difference-of-means test (`ctype = "DOM"`) with user-specified values for `mu_list` and `sigma_list`. Unlike the first approach, this method allows for greater flexibility in specifying parameter distributions.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
mu_r <- setNames(rep(log(1.00), 5), paste0("y", 1:5))
mu_t <- setNames(rep(log(1.05), 5), paste0("y", 1:5))
sigma <- setNames(rep(0.3, 5), paste0("y", 1:5))
lequi_lower <- setNames(rep(log(0.8), 5), paste0("y", 1:5))
lequi_upper <- setNames(rep(log(1.25), 5), paste0("y", 1:5))

ss <- sampleSize(power = 0.8, alpha = 0.05,
                 mu_list = list("R" = mu_r, "T" = mu_t),
                 sigma_list = list("R" = sigma, "T" = sigma),
                 list_comparator = list(c("R", "T")),
                 list_lequi.tol = list("T_vs_R" = lequi_lower),
                 list_uequi.tol = list("T_vs_R" = lequi_upper),
                 dtype = "parallel", ctype = "DOM", lognorm = FALSE, 
                 adjust = "no", ncores = 1, nsim = 10000, seed = 1234)
ss
```     
For 80\% power, a total of `r ss$response %>% pull(n_total)` would be required. 


# Multiple Correlated Co-Primary Endpoints
In the second example, we have $k=m=5$, $\sigma = 0.3$ and $\rho = 0.8$. Again, we can estimate the sample size using the functions provided by @mielke_sample_2018: 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ssMielke <- sampleSize_Mielke(power = 0.8, Nmax = 1000, m = 5, k = 5, rho = 0.8, 
                              sigma = 0.3, true.diff =  log(1.05), 
                              equi.tol = log(1.25), design = "parallel", 
                              alpha = 0.05, adjust = "no", seed = 1234, 
                              nsim = 10000)
ssMielke
```
For 80\% power, `r ssMielke["SS"]` subjects per sequence (`r ssMielke["SS"] * 2` in total) would have been required. 

We can perform the same analysis using [sampleSize()](../reference/sampleSize.html). In this case, we provide estimates for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ on the original scale, assuming they follow a normal distribution on the log scale (`lognorm = TRUE`). Instead of testing the difference of log-transformed means, we now test the ratio of the (untransformed) means.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ss <- sampleSize(power = 0.8, alpha = 0.05,
                 mu_list = list("R" = rep(1.00, 5),
                                "T" = rep(1.05, 5)),
                 sigma_list = list("R" = rep(0.3, 5),
                                   "T" = rep(0.3, 5)),
                 rho = 0.8, # high correlation between the endpoints
                 lequi.tol = rep(0.8, 5),
                 uequi.tol = rep(1.25, 5),
                 dtype = "parallel", ctype = "ROM", lognorm = TRUE, 
                 adjust = "no", ncores = 1, k = 5, nsim = 10000, seed = 1234)
ss
```
