\title{Plot Power vs Sample Size for Simulation Results}
\usage{
\method{plot}{simss}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{simss} containing simulation results.}

\item{\ldots}{Additional arguments to be passed to the \code{plot.simss} function for customization.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object illustrating:
\itemize{
\item Power (y-axis) vs. Total Sample Size (x-axis) for individual endpoints and comparators.
\item Error bars representing the 95\% confidence interval of the power estimates.
\item A dashed horizontal line indicating the target power for comparison.
\item Faceted panels for each comparator, making it easy to compare results across different groups.
}
}
\description{
Generates a detailed plot showing the relationship between power and total sample size for each comparator and the overall combined comparators.
The plot also includes confidence intervals for power estimates and highlights the target power with a dashed line for easy visual comparison.
}
\details{
The plot dynamically adjusts to exclude unnecessary components, such as redundant endpoints or comparators with insufficient data, ensuring clarity and simplicity.
The \code{ggplot2} framework is used for visualizations, allowing further customization if needed.
