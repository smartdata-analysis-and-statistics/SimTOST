\arguments{
\item{nsim}{Integer. The number of simulations to run.}

\item{sigmaB}{Numeric. Between-subject variance for the crossover model.}

\item{dropout}{Numeric vector of size 2. Dropout rates for each sequence.}

\item{Eper}{Numeric vector. Expected period effects for each sequence.}

\item{Eco}{Numeric vector. Expected carryover effects for each sequence.}

\item{typey}{Integer vector indicating the classification of each endpoint, where \code{1} corresponds to a primary endpoint and \code{2} corresponds to a secondary endpoint.}

}
\value{
A numeric matrix where each column stores simulation results:
The first row (\code{totaly}) represents the overall equivalence decision (1 = success, 0 = failure).
Subsequent rows contain p-values for equivalence testing per endpoint (\verb{E1, E2, ...}),
mean estimates for the treatment group (\verb{mu_E1_T, mu_E2_T, ...}), mean estimates for the reference group (\verb{mu_E1_R, mu_E2_R, ...}),
standard deviations for treatment (\verb{sd_E1_T, sd_E2_T, ...}), and standard deviations for reference (\verb{sd_E1_R, sd_E2_R, ...}).
}
\description{
This function simulates a 2x2 crossover study design across multiple iterations (\code{nsim}).
It evaluates equivalence testing for multiple endpoints using either the
Difference of Means (DOM) or Ratio of Means (ROM) approach.
}
\details{
This function performs equivalence testing using either the Difference of Means (DOM) or Ratio of Means (ROM) approach.
Equivalence is determined based on predefined lower (\code{lequi_tol}) and upper (\code{uequi_tol}) equivalence thresholds,
and hypothesis testing is conducted at the specified significance level (\code{alpha}).
If \code{adseq} is \code{TRUE}, primary endpoints must establish equivalence before secondary endpoints are evaluated.
The sample size per period is adjusted based on dropout rates, ensuring valid study conclusions.
The simulation incorporates within-subject correlation using \code{SigmaW} and accounts for between-subject variance with \code{sigmaB}.
Expected period effects (\code{Eper}) and carryover effects (\code{Eco}) are included in the model.
A fixed random seed (\code{arm_seed}) is used to ensure reproducibility across simulations.
