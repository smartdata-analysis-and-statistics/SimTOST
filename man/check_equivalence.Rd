\title{Check Equivalence for Multiple Endpoints}
\usage{
check_equivalence(typey, adseq, tbioq, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{typey}{An integer vector specifying the hierarchy of each endpoint, where \code{1} denotes a primary endpoint and \code{2} denotes a secondary endpoint.}

\item{adseq}{A boolean flag indicating whether sequential testing is enabled. If set to \code{TRUE}, all primary endpoints must pass equivalence before secondary endpoints are evaluated. If set to \code{FALSE}, primary and secondary endpoints are assessed independently.}

\item{tbioq}{A matrix containing the equivalence test results for each endpoint, where \code{1} indicates that equivalence is met and \code{0} indicates that equivalence is not met.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the minimum number of endpoints required for overall equivalence.}
}
\value{
Returns a (1 Ã— 1 matrix) containing a binary equivalence decision. A value of \code{1} indicates that equivalence is established, while \code{0} indicates that equivalence is not established.
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether equivalence criteria are met based on a predefined set of endpoints. It first checks whether all primary endpoints satisfy equivalence (if sequential testing is enabled). Then, it determines whether the required number of endpoints (\code{k}) meet the equivalence threshold. The function returns a binary decision indicating whether overall equivalence is established.
}
\details{
When sequential testing is enabled (\code{adseq = TRUE}), all primary endpoints must meet equivalence before secondary endpoints are considered. If sequential testing is disabled (\code{adseq = FALSE}), all endpoints are evaluated simultaneously without hierarchical constraints. The function then determines whether at least \code{k} endpoints meet the equivalence criteria. If the conditions are satisfied, the final equivalence decision (\code{totaly}) is \code{1}; otherwise, it is \code{0}.
