\item{mu_list}{Named list of arithmetic means per treatment arm. Each element contains a vector (i.e., one per treatment arm) with the expected outcomes for all endpoints of interest.}

\item{varcov_list}{list of var-cov matrices, each element corresponds to a comparator with a varcov matrix of size number of endpoints X number of endpoints.}

\item{sigma_list}{list of sigma vectors, each element corresponds to a comparator with a sigma vector of size number of endpoints.}

\item{cor_mat}{matrix specifying the correlation matrix between endpoints, used along with sigma_list  to calculate the varcov list in case it is not provided.}

\item{sigmaB}{number between subject variance only for 2x2 design.}

\item{Eper}{vector of size 2, effect of period on c(0,1).}

\item{Eco}{vector of size 2, carry over effect of arm c(Reference, Treatment).}

\item{rho}{correlation parameter to fix on all the pair of endpoints, used along with sigma_list to calculate the varcov list in case neither cor_mat or var-cov list is not provided.}

\item{TAR}{vector of allocation rates with allocation rates of the arm, default is equivalent rate.}

\item{arm_names}{Optional vector with the treatment names. If not supplied, it will be derived from mu_list.}

\item{ynames_list}{Optional list of vectors with Endpoint names on each arm. When not all endpoint names are provided for each arm, arbitrary names (assigned by vector order) are used.}

\item{type_y}{vector with the type of endpoints: primary endpoint(1), otherwise (2).}

\item{list_comparator}{list of comparators, i.e each comparator is a vector of size 1 X 2 where are specified the name of treatments}

\item{list_y_comparator}{list of endpoints to be considered in each comparator. Each element of the list is a vector containing the names of the endpoints to compare. When it is not provided, all endpoints present in both compared arms are used.}

\item{power}{target power (default = 0.8)}

\item{alpha}{alpha level (default = 0.05)}

\item{lequi.tol}{lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in raw scale units (e.g., scalepoints) of endpoint repeated on all endpoints and comparators}

\item{list_lequi.tol}{list of lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in raw scale units (e.g., scalepoints) of endpoint in comparator}

\item{vareq}{variance equivalence assumption (FALSE, TRUE)}

\item{lognorm}{Is data log-normally distributed? (TRUE, FALSE)}

\item{k}{Vector with the number of endpoints that must be successful (integer) for global bioequivalence for each comparator. If no k vector is provided, it will be set to the total number of endpoints on each comparator.}

\item{dropout}{vector with proportion of total population with dropout per arm}

\item{nsim}{number of simulated studies (default=5000)}

\item{lower}{initial value of N to be searched (default=2)}

\item{upper}{max value of N to be searched (default=500)}

\item{seed}{main seed}

\item{ncores}{number of cores used for the calculation if not provided it will use number of cores detected - 1}

\item{step.power}{initial step size is 2^step.power}

\item{step.up}{if TRUE steps up from 'lower', if FALSE steps down from 'upper'}

\item{pos.side}{if TRUE finds integer, i, closest to the root such that f(i) >0}
